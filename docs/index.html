      <p>For quite a while, I've viewed getting a job in programming as the height of success (as someone who wants to work from home, and to be able to live anywhere).  Every day for years, I've plodded along through online courses, coding podcasts, immersive blogs or vlogs about life as a software developer, collecting certifications in web development along the way. </p>

      <p>The more I worked at it, the more I realized just how many people wanted the same thing, to be scooped up by a company as a remote junior developer. </p>
